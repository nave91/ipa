# IPA

IPA is a python package for Asynchronous API Consumer inspired from [Finch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/finch).

Instead of using [Booby](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/booby/0.7.0), this package helps define schema or models or tables in sqlalchemy orm.
Sqlalchemy helps store the data in any database supported by it and gives flexibility to take advantage of various db technologies. 

The consumed data is stored in any database by defining schema in sqlalchemy.
